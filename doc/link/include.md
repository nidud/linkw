Linker Reference

## /INCLUDE

**/INCLUDE**:_symbol_

The /INCLUDE option tells the linker to add a specified _symbol_ to the symbol table.

The linker resolves symbol by adding the object that contains the symbol definition to the program. This feature is useful for including a library object that otherwise would not be linked to the program.
