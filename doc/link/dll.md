## /DLL

**/DLL**

The /DLL option builds a DLL as the main output file. A DLL usually contains exports that can be used by another program. There are three methods for specifying exports, listed in recommended order of use:

- The **export** keyword in the source code
- An EXPORTS statement in a .def file
- An /EXPORT specification in a LINKW command
